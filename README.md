## Description

_My third attempt in the last 24 months to teach myself code starting with the first lesson at www.learninghowtoprogram.com. Since I've already printed "Hello World" a few dozen times in my life, I went with a casual "Hey World" this time-- since we've gotten to know each other a bit through the years. Then, instead of the lesson suggestions about saying hello in various languages, I stuck with using some of my favorite phrases from the Swahili hadithi/story of the Tortoise and the Hare (Kobe na Sangura). I also learned about coding bullet lists in HTML and using "commits" to save and update code progress. Slowly but surely, these perpetual midlife crises will allow me to develop skills so that I won't think of my time on Earth as a complete waste. Right?...Right?_

_If you have any questions, or want me to stop writing these Chuck-Lorre-esque vanity-card-like descriptions...Yeah, please let me know at JuliaC652@yahoo.com. I don't want to become a monster like Chuck Lorre. The good he gave through the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle theme song was taken away by Two and A Half Men and the Big Bang Theory._
